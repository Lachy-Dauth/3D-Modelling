        <h3>What is 3D Printing, Why Is it So Useful In STEM?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>3D printing is a quick and easy way to make things out of plastic, it can help us create stuff that we would find expensive to make molds or use metal or plastic to create</li>
          <li>3D printing is a great way to get introduced into the world of engineering, as it is safe (for the most part) for children</li>
          <li>The power of 3D printing can resolve many modern day issues, can create cheap and easy alternative solutions that we use in everyday life, helping us making quick and easy solutions to problems that don’t need expensive or crazy solutions</li>
          <li>What is a problem you think you can solve with 3D printing? (Other than world hunger)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Are 3D Prints Made Of?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Well the filament is a plastic like material that is made out of: Plastic, Sugar Cane and Corn</li>
          <li>Because it is a plastic, it is easy to use and shape</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Can You Make With 3D Printers?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Chess Sets</li>
          <li>Lego People</li>
          <li>And the top thing in 2017: fidget spinners</li>
          <li>Along with so much more</li>

      <p>3D printers are a complex piece of machinery that comes with safety rules every user should follow. I’ve put together a list of these rules so follow these rules and be confident about your safety through your 3D printing journey.</p>
      <section>
        <h3>Rules To Follow</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Never Touch The Nozzle With The Machine On</li>
          <li>Never Touch Any Part Of The Printer While It Is In Use</li>
          <li>Never Touch The Bed While Heated</li>
          <li>Be Careful Of Pinch Points</li>
          <li>Be Extra Careful With Scraper Blades</li>
          <li>Be Aware Of Any Other Dangers</li>
        </ol>
      </section>
    </section>
    <p>Please respect and follow these rules, not doing so could cause harm to you, or could damage the printer.</p>
