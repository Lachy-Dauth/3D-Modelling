        <h3>What is 3D Printing, Why Is it So Useful In STEM?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>3D printing is a quick and easy way to make things out of plastic, it can help us create stuff that we would find expensive to make molds or use metal or plastic to create</li>
          <li>3D printing is a great way to get introduced into the world of engineering, as it is safe (for the most part) for children</li>
          <li>The power of 3D printing can resolve many modern day issues, can create cheap and easy alternative solutions that we use in everyday life, helping us making quick and easy solutions to problems that don’t need expensive or crazy solutions</li>
          <li>What is a problem you think you can solve with 3D printing? (Other than world hunger)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Are 3D Prints Made Of?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Well the filament is a plastic like material that is made out of: Plastic, Sugar Cane and Corn</li>
          <li>Because it is a plastic, it is easy to use and shape</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Can You Make With 3D Printers?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Chess Sets</li>
          <li>Lego People</li>
          <li>And the top thing in 2017: fidget spinners</li>
          <li>Along with so much more</li>

      <header>Safety</header>
      <p>3D printers are a complex piece of machinery that comes with safety rules every user should follow. I’ve put together a list of these rules so follow these rules and be confident about your safety through your 3D printing journey.</p>
      <section>
        <h3>Rules To Follow</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Never Touch The Nozzle With The Machine On</li>
          <li>Never Touch Any Part Of The Printer While It Is In Use</li>
          <li>Never Touch The Bed While Heated</li>
          <li>Be Careful Of Pinch Points</li>
          <li>Be Extra Careful With Scraper Blades</li>
          <li>Be Aware Of Any Other Dangers</li>
        </ol>
      </section>
    </section>
    <p>Please respect and follow these rules, not doing so could cause harm to you, or could damage the printer.</p>

      <p>Here you will learn how to use TinkerCad to make and export 3D models. We have three tutorials you can work through. They are simple and easy to follow, but I would recommend doing them in order. After you complete some of these and start to feel confident, you can try making something by your self. Some cool things to make are another chess piece I recommend a castle, a pencil holder, a phone stand or a decoration.</p>

      <p>In this section we will learn to slice the 3D models. For this section we will assume you have the STL file you would like to print. If you had not made a model you can download the <a href="./Test-files/Benchy.stl" download>Benchy Test File</a>, the <a href="./Test-files/Calibration-cube.stl" download>Calibration Cube File</a> or the <a href="./Test-files/Name-tag.stl" download>Name Tag Test File</a>.</p>

      <p>In this section we will learn to get the printer calibrated. We will also tell you how to print your gcode files. For this section we will assume you have the gcode file you would like to print on the sd card. If you had not made a model you can download the <a href="./Test-files/Benchy.gcode" download>Benchy Gcode</a>, the <a href="./Test-files/Calibration-cube.gcode" download>Calibration Cube Gcode</a> or the <a href="./Test-files/Name-tag.gcode" download>Name Tag Gcode</a> then put the file on a micro sd card.</p>
